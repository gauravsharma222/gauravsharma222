👋 Hey hey! I'm a **QA Engineer** who professionally breaks stuff so users don't have to 🐛💥

🧪 **What I do (besides drink too much Tea ☕):**  
🔹 Manual Testing – AKA "clicking everything until something explodes" 🖱️💣
🔹 Automation Testing – because who has time to click the same button 500 times? 🤖
🔹 **API Testing** – chatting with servers like an undercover agent 🕵️‍♂️📡  
🔹 **Load Testing** – I love watching systems cry under pressure 💪🔥  
🔹 **Selenium** – bthe OG browser whisperer 🕷️
🔹 **Appium** – because mobile apps need love too 📱❤️  
🔹 **Playwright** – for drama-free end-to-end tests 🎭  
🔹 **Cypress** – because fast and flaky-free is my vibe 🌲⚡

🛠️ **Also... I'm not just a tester – I build things too!**  
🔸 Developer of **Windows Applications** using **C# + WinForms** 🪟💻  
🔸 Built APIs with **Spring Boot** 🌱  
🔸 Some light tinkering in **ASP.NET** – enough to be dangerous and deploy weird things 😅  
🔸 Fluent in **C#** 💙 and **Java** ☕ – the bilingual bug buster

🧠 I like breaking things. I like fixing things. I *really* like finding things that no one else noticed 🔍✨  
💬 Let’s connect – whether it’s QA talk, coding banter, or just a good meme exchange 😎📲
